## Blockchain Integrations

This website integrates with the following blockchain APIs and services:

- **Unisat API**: For broadcasting transactions and creating inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain.
- **Blockchain.com API**: For retrieving real-time Bitcoin blockchain data.
- **Leather API**: For seamless integration with the Leather Bitcoin wallet.

### Student Membership Cards

The `NAT.js` file handles the generation of these student membership cards. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Data Pattern Analysis**: The application retrieves real-time Bitcoin blockchain data, such as the current block height and transaction count, from the Blockchain.com API.
2. This data is analyzed to identify patterns that will be used to generate unique traits and characteristics for the student membership cards.

3. **Card Generation**: Based on the identified patterns, the application generates a unique SVG image representing the student membership card.
This SVG image includes various traits and characteristics derived from the blockchain data patterns.

5. **User Account Update**: The generated SVG image is associated with the user's account, representing their unique student membership card.

By leveraging the principles of Digital Matter Theory, the application creates unique and verifiable digital assets representing student membership cards.

### Redesign Page

The redesign page is a replica of the Coding Temple courses page but with a few key differences:

- **Connect Button**: This page includes a "Connect" button that allows users to connect their cryptocurrency wallets (Unisat, Xverse, and Leather).
- **New Course**: In addition to the existing courses, the redesign page features a new course on Blockchain Development.
- **Different Design**: The page has a refreshed design and layout, incorporating elements such as gradients and SVG graphics.
- **Get A Membership Card Button**: Each course section includes a "Get A Membership Card" button. When clicked, this button initiates the process of creating an inscription order on the Unisat API using the user's signed message.
